**Station 1: Release Ticket Finder** 🔧

Give each station **its own page** so you can test and fix it alone, like a part on a workbench before it goes in the car.

**1. Create a page called `Agent 01 – Release Ticket Finder` and paste this:**

> **Purpose:** Find the release ticket for a given VERSION.
>
> **When asked "find release ticket for VERSION":**
> 1. Run this JQL, replacing VERSION:
>    `project = BTFM AND labels = RetirementReleaseTicket AND summary ~ "\"Release VERSION\""`
> 2. Check each result's title. Keep it **only** if it contains "Release VERSION" followed by a space or the end of the title. "Release 1.1" must NOT match "Release 1.11".
> 3. Reply with **exactly one line**, nothing else:
>    - one match → `RELEASE_TICKET: <KEY>`
>    - no match → `RELEASE_TICKET: NOT_FOUND`
>    - more than one → `RELEASE_TICKET: MULTIPLE: <KEY1>, <KEY2>`

**Why the strict one-line output?** Later the orchestrator will read this answer and pass it to the next station. It's like a standard bolt size: every station has to fit the next one.

**2. Run these 4 test drives** (start a new Rovo chat for each):
> Read "Agent 01 – Release Ticket Finder" and find release ticket for **X**

| Test | X | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| A | 1.11 | `BTFM-13034` (from the answer key) |
| B | 1.2 | `BTFM-11420` |
| C | 9.99 | `NOT_FOUND` |
| D | 1.1 | Must **not** say 13034. This is the trap. |

**Your task:** Send me a ✅ or ❌ for each test. If A fails, check whether BTFM-13034 actually has the `RetirementReleaseTicket` label.
